In the dynamic world of stock trading, leveraging data-driven insights is key to staying ahead. Here’s a breakdown of a recent analysis I conducted, combining predictive modeling, technical indicators, and strategy backtesting to navigate market trends:

📈 1. Stock Price Prediction: Actual vs. Predicted

Analyzed historical close prices (from 2000) against machine learning-predicted values (2010–2022).

The model tracked long-term trends, highlighting periods where predictions aligned with or diverged from actual prices. This helps refine forecasting accuracy for future strategies.

🎯 2. Trading Signals (BUY/SELL)

Generated signals based on momentum and trend indicators. For instance, BUY signals during undervalued phases (e.g., 2014–2016) and SELL signals near market peaks (e.g., 2018–2020).

Timing these signals effectively can optimize entry/exit points and enhance returns.

📊 3. Market Trends: Price & RSI

Monitored the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) conditions.

Example: RSI dips below 30 in 2016, signaling a potential buying opportunity before a price rebound.

⚡ 4. Stock Volatility & Daily Returns

Assessed volatility patterns, with daily returns ranging from +0.2 to -1.0. Higher volatility in 2020–2022 reflects market uncertainty (e.g., pandemic impacts).

Understanding volatility helps manage risk and adjust position sizing.

🔍 5. Backtesting Trading Strategy (2010–2012)

Simulated strategy performance across 8 quarters, validating its effectiveness during varying market conditions.

Key takeaway: Consistent risk-adjusted returns demonstrate the strategy’s robustness in shorter cycles.
